# TYPES OF MATRICES
In this project, I explored various types of matrices and their properties, with Python implementations for each. Here‚Äôs a summary of what‚Äôs covered:

üî¢ Types of Matrices:
Square matrices
Principal diagonal
Trace
Diagonal matrix
Scalar matrix
Unit (Identity) matrix
Null (Zero) matrix
Row and Column matrices
Triangular matrix

‚ûó Matrix Operations:
Equality of matrices
Sum of two matrices

‚öôÔ∏è Properties of Matrix Addition:
Commutative Property
Associative Property
Additive Identity
Additive Inverse

I used NumPy to implement these concepts and demonstrate how they work with practical examples.
