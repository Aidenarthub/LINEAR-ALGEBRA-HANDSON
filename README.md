# ðŸ“˜ Detailed Syllabus for Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra

## 1. Types of Matrices
### Types of Matrices:
1. **Square Matrices**  
   - **Principal Diagonal**: Elements on the main diagonal.
   - **Trace**: Sum of the elements on the principal diagonal.
2. **Diagonal Matrix**: A square matrix in which all off-diagonal elements are zero.
3. **Scalar Matrix**: A diagonal matrix in which all diagonal elements are equal.
4. **Unit (Identity) Matrix**: A diagonal matrix in which all diagonal elements are $1$.
5. **Null (Zero) Matrix**: A matrix in which all elements are zero.
6. **Row and Column Matrices**: Matrices with only one row or one column.
7. **Triangular Matrix**:  
   - **Upper Triangular Matrix**: All elements below the main diagonal are zero.
   - **Lower Triangular Matrix**: All elements above the main diagonal are zero.

### Matrix Operations:
1. **Equality of Matrices**: Two matrices are equal if they have the same order and corresponding elements are equal.
2. **Sum of Two Matrices**: Addition of corresponding elements.

### Properties of Matrix Addition:
1. **Commutative Property**: $A + B = B + A$
2. **Associative Property**: $(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)$
3. **Additive Identity**: $A + 0 = A$ (0 is the zero matrix)
4. **Additive Inverse**: $A + (-A) = 0$

## 2. Scalar Multiplication and Matrix Multiplication
### Scalar Multiple of a Matrix:
- **Distributive Property over Matrix**: $c(A + B) = cA + cB$
- **Distributive Property over Scalar**: $(c + d)A = cA + dA$
- **Associative Property over Scalar**: $c(dA) = (cd)A$
- **Multiplicative Identity**: $1 \cdot A = A$
- **Multiplication by Zero**: $0 \cdot A = 0$

### Matrix Multiplication:
- **Non-Commutativity**: $AB \neq BA$ (in general)
- **Associative Property**: $A(BC) = (AB)C$
- **Distributive Property**: $A(B + C) = AB + AC$
- **Multiplication by Identity Matrix**: $AI = IA = A$
- **Zero Matrix Property**: $A \cdot 0 = 0$

### Transpose of a Matrix and its Properties:
- **Symmetric Matrix**: A matrix $A$ such that $A^T = A$
- **Skew-Symmetric Matrix**: A matrix $A$ such that $A^T = -A$

## 3. Determinants
- **Definition of Determinants**: A scalar value that is a function of a square matrix and provides important properties of the matrix.
- **Minor of an Element**: The determinant of a submatrix obtained by deleting the row and column of a given element.
- **Cofactor of an Element**: The signed minor of an element.
- **Python Implementation of Determinant**: Practical examples of calculating determinants using Python.
- **Properties of Determinants**: Various properties, such as multiplication rules, determinant of transpose, etc.

## 4. Inverse of a Matrix
- **Singular and Non-Singular Matrices**:  
  - **Singular Matrix**: A matrix with a determinant of zero.
  - **Non-Singular Matrix**: A matrix with a non-zero determinant.
- **Adjoint of a Matrix**: The transpose of the cofactor matrix, used to find the inverse.
- **Invertible Matrix**: A matrix that has an inverse.
- **Properties of Invertible Matrices**:  
  1. $(A^{-1})^{-1} = A$
  2. $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$
  3. $\text{det}(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)}$

## 5. System of Equations and Rank of a Matrix
- **Non-Homogeneous Equation**: Equations of the form $AX = D$ where $D \neq 0$.
- **Matrix Representation of Non-Homogeneous Equation**: Representation using a coefficient matrix.
- **Augmented Matrix**: A matrix that represents a system of linear equations, including the constants.
- **Homogeneous Equation**: Equations of the form $AX = 0$.
- **Matrix Form of Homogeneous Equation**: Representation of a homogeneous system using matrices.
- **Submatrix**: A matrix formed by deleting one or more rows or columns from a larger matrix.
- **Rank of a Matrix**: The maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix.

## 6. Solution of System of Equations
- **Consistent and Inconsistent Systems**:  
  - **Consistent**: A system with at least one solution.
  - **Inconsistent**: A system with no solution.
- **Cramer's Rule for Solving Linear Systems**: A method for finding the solution of a system using determinants.
- **Matrix Inversion Method for Solving Linear Systems**: Solving $AX = D$ using $X = A^{-1}D$.
- **Python Implementation on Non-Homogeneous Matrix**: Example of solving non-homogeneous equations using Python.
- **Python Implementation on Homogeneous Matrix**: Example of solving homogeneous equations using Python.
- **Definition of Trivial Solution**: The zero solution for a homogeneous system ($X = 0$).
